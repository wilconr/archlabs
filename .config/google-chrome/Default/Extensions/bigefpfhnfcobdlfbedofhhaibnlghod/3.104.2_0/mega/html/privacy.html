      <hr />

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="text">This Policy governs our processing of your personal information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information. &ldquo;Personal information&rdquo; is the New Zealand term for &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; as defined in the European Union&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;). The term &ldquo;processing&rdquo; is used as defined in the GDPR. It includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.  You are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below). Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="number">2</span> <span class="text">This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data. Words and phrases which are defined in our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">Terms of Service</a> (&ldquo;ToS&rdquo;) have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="text">The sections of this Policy are:</span> </p>

      <p class="list"> <span class="number">3.2</span> <span class="text">The <a class="scroll_to" data-scrollto="#your_files">&ldquo;Your Files&rdquo;</a> section. This covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.</span> </p>

      <h2 id="your_files">Your Files</h2>
      <p> <span class="number">5</span> <span class="text">This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (&ldquo;Your Files&rdquo;). The following specific terms apply:</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">5.1</span> <span class="text">When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains. We also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file. We gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains. In relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering <a class="scroll_to" data-scrollto="#account_data">Account Data</a>.</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">5.2</span> <span class="text">All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system. They are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access. Your Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993) since they are never held by Mega in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">5.3</span> <span class="text">We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">ToS</a>. </span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">5.4</span> <span class="text">Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR, depending where you are based. None of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">5.5</span> <span class="text">We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">ToS</a>. You must maintain copies of Your Files. We do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free. You should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 12 below). If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">5.6</span> <span class="text">When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">ToS</a>. After account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">ToS</a>. </span> </p>

Public chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat. Every text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (&ldquo;blob&rdquo;). The times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form. The content of voice and video chats is not retained. If you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately. When you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">6.2</span> <span class="text">All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system. They are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device. Your Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993) since they are never held by Mega in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">6.3</span> <span class="text">We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">ToS</a>.</span> </p>

      <p> <span class="number">9</span> <span class="text">This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.</span> </p>

      <h3>Basis of processing and dealing with data</h3>
      <p class="first"> <span class="number">10</span> <span class="text">As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">ToS</a>, this Policy, and our <a class="clickurl" href="/takedown">Takedown Guidance Policy</a>. We cannot provide our services without that data. Other data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">ToS</a>, this Policy, and our <a class="clickurl" href="/takedown">Takedown Guidance Policy</a>.</span> </p>

      <h3>Giving access to other users</h3>
      <p class="first"> <span class="number">11</span> <span class="text">You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">ToS</a>, our <a class="clickurl" href="/takedown">Takedown Guidance Policy</a> and this Policy. You are responsible for their compliance.  This applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="number">12</span> <span class="text">For business accounts, to the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).  In addition:</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">12.1</span> <span class="text">if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account;</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">12.2</span> <span class="text">the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information);</span> </p>
      <p class="list"> <span class="number">12.3</span> <span class="text">the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user&rsquo;s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user&rsquo;s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.</span> </p>

      <h3>Your own security practices are critical</h3>
      <p class="first"> <span class="number">13</span> <span class="text">We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g. via unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices). Mega will never send an email asking for your password or suggesting that you click a link to login to your account, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us. We cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access. Also, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data. If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key. Using the same password for Mega as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your Mega account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked. </span> </p>

      <h3>Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement</h3>
      <p class="first"> <span class="number">14</span> <span class="text">If we think it is necessary or we have to by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Website Usage Data to competent authorities.

We also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.

      <p class="first"> <span class="number">18</span> <span class="text">We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems. They will be deemed to be received in accordance with our <a class="clickurl" href="/terms">ToS</a> .</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="number">19</span> <span class="text">If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt. We will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="number">20</span> <span class="text">In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake. In these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files. On request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.</span> </p>
