We provide services ourselves and via our <a class="clickurl" href="/contact">related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers</a> who act on our behalf, at our website at <a href="https://mega.nz">https://mega.nz</a>, subdomains and related sites ("website"), using our mobile apps ("mobile apps"), and our application programming interface (&ldquo;API&rdquo;). Using Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and data by way of user-controlled encryption ("UCE"), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, information, material, text chats, voice chats, video chats and other data (all of which we call "data" in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, "services" and each, a "service"). If you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our <a class="clickurl" href="/help">Help Centre</a> or, if you can't find the answer there, check our <a class="clickurl" href="/contact">contacts</a> page for details of who to contact.</span>

By using our services, the website or our mobile apps, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms. If you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound, you can't use our services, the website or our mobile apps. In particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 37-48.

                <span class="text">We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via our website, via our mobile apps, by sending you an email or via any messaging service we provide. Your continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms. If you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force. We will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account. For more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 55-57.</span>

                <span class="text">UCE is fundamental to our services. This means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data. You should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential. You must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data. If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data. Encryption won&rsquo;t help though if someone has full access to your system or device. We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g. via unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices). Mega will never send you emails asking for your password or suggesting that you click a link to login to your account, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.</span>

In that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms. Any right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.</span>

                    <br><br>If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes. See also clauses 51-54 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.
                    <br><br>In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.
