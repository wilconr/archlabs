2020-09-25 15:32:01.757870932 [W:onnxruntime:, graph.cc:814 Graph] Initializer embeddings_matrix:0_quantized appears in graph inputs and will not be treated as constant value/weight. This may fail some of the graph optimizations, like const folding. Move it out of graph inputs if there is no need to override it, by either re-generating the model with latest exporter/converter or with the tool onnxruntime/tools/python/remove_initializer_from_input.py.
